# Python-bound SAP Solver in Eigen
## About
C++/Eigen implementation of a solver for strictly convex Lorentz cone-constrained Quadratic Programs (LCQP's), equivalent to strongly monotone Second Order Linear Complementarity Problems (SOLCP's), based on Alejandro Castro et al.'s [Semi-Analytic Primal Solver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10107.pdf), developed by Toyota Research Institute.
